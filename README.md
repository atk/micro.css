# micro.css
## CSS micro framework

This is a minimal framework build from small interchangeable components. It relies on postCSS for its build process.

### Configuration

Edit the colors and border radius in `src/config.css`, change the modules to include (or not) in `src/base.css`.

### Building

    npm install

### License and Changes

This small framework is available under the terms of the MIT license. Help and corrections are appreciated.
